# Fish Pondering

Make fish ponds draw correctly at smaller sizes, by altering the scale.

## Features

- Compatibile with all fish pond replacer mods.
- All fish ponds become 4x4 upon installing this mod, and reverts to 5x5 on uninstallation.
- No gameplay changes were made, hopefully no conflict with mods that do alter fish pond gameplay mechanics.
- Fish pond sign size unchanged.

## Why this mod instead of [The Return of Smaller Fish Ponds](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21900)?

- Works in 1.6.14+.
- Written with 1.6 building features in mind, should have less multiplayer/splitscreen bugs.

## Config

### **Pond Size**

Size of pond in terms of tile width. The recommended value is 4.

Aside from 3 and 4, you can change "PondSize" in config.json directly. Just note that it looks really strange and I am not responsible for any issues that occur.

## Translations

- English
- Simplified Chinese

More translations are welcome, preferrably added to the main mod but separate page is fine.

## Future Plans?

- Proper 3x3 fish pond building that is balanced for that size (no legendary fish, less productive).
- Proper 2x2 fish pond that only loads a limited selection of small, to encourage variety.

Will need to find artist and devise balance for this, so don't expect it anytime soon.
